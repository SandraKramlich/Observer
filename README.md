# Observer
This Repository is for my e-Portfolio in Software Engineering Class.

The e-Portfolio is about the Observer-Pattern, what it is, how it works, its adventages and disadventages.
There is also included a example written in Java and implementet in Eclipse.

Be aware that the slides and comments in the exaple are all German.
